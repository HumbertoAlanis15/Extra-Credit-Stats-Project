# Extra-Credit-Stats-Project
We found a detailed database from Kaggle.com about cars that includes a lot of information. This dataset lists car manufacturers, the specific models they make, and the types of engines each model uses. It also provides important specifications like engine capacity, horsepower, and maximum speed. Performance metrics show how fast a car can go from 0 to 100 km/h, along with pricing details for each vehicle. Additionally, cars are organized by fuel type, the number of seats, and torque.

Our goal is in analyzing whether the average price of electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrids is higher than that of traditional petrol and gas cars. We will compare the average costs of imported cars versus domestic ones and check if V8 engines generally cost more than V6 engines. Furthermore, we’ll examine performance metrics, comparing the average torque of EVs and hybrids against petrol and gas cars to see if EVs and hybrids provide better torque. We will also look at the proportion of high-performance vehicles in both categories, specifically whether the share of high-performance EVs and hybrids, defined as cars that can accelerate from 0 to 60 MPH in under 5 seconds, differs significantly from that of high-performance petrol and gas vehicles. Finally, we’ll analyze the number of luxury V8 cars compared to luxury V6 cars, with luxury defined as vehicles that cost over $50,000
